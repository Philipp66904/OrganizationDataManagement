# OrganizationDataManagement
OrganizationDataManagement (ODM) is a tool designed for effective management and tracking of addresses and personal data shared with different organizations.  
Boasting a user-friendly interface with customizable features, ODM simplifies the process of updating, connection, and searching data, whilst ensuring optimal data privacy and minimization of redundancy.

## Use Case
The OrganizationDataManagement (ODM) program is a comprehensive tool designed to help manage and search through the various addresses you've shared with different companies.  
Whether you're relocating and need to alter all address details or simply intend to keep track of the companies possessing your information, ODM is all you need.

ODM achieves this by allowing you to add people, addresses and organizations independently and by creating a linkage accros these categories.  
Additionally, the search tab proves instrumental in the quick search of specific or connected entries.  

To avoid clutter and minimize redundant data entries, for instance, varied name spellings or minor variations, ODM provides the option of creating derivatives of entries.  
Importantly, on deletion of the parent entry, all derivatives are also removed, thereby maintaining an clean database.  

Furthermore, ODM's user interface is highly customizable, with options for independent color modifications and automatic adaptations to your timezone and language settings (subject to translation availability).

ODM allows effortless tracking of shared information, with the added assurance of your information remaining on your device.  
The choice of where to store files rests entirely with you, ensuring optimal user convenience and control.
